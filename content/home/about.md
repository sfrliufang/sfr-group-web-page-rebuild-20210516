Low dimensional materials and the unique structures built from them has a variety of new exotic properties beyond traditional materials. We hope to produce low dimensional materials and their artificial structures in a sizable and controllable way. Our ultimate goal is to use these materials to provide novel platforms for next-generation information processing, light processing, and quantum devices. In order to do that, we need to unravel their static and dynamical electronic, magnetic and photonic properties, using the cutting edge characterization techniques including optical and photoemission spectroscopy. We are an experimental material / physical chemistry group. Welcome to join us!
