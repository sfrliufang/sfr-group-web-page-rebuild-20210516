Aï»¿my and Fang were excited to participate in the first USG-CA 2D Materials Wokshop which featured students and professors from academic and government labs across California and the United States.  Amy presented a poster on her hBN work and Prof. Liu gave a talk summarizing all the work going on in the lab.  It was amazing meeting so many new graduate students and professors!
